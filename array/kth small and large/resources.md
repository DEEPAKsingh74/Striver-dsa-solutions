# Problem Statement :

Given an array arr[] and an integer k where k is smaller than the size of the array, the task is to find the kth smallest element and kth largest element in the given array.

#### Examples :

Input: arr[] = [7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15], k = 3
Output:  7, 10


Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 1, 20, 15], k = 4 
Output: 15, 2

#### Constraints :

1 <= arr.size <= 106
1<= arr[i] <= 106
1 <= k <= n
