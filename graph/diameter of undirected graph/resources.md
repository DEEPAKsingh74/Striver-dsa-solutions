# Problem Statement :

Given an undirected tree, return the diameter: the number of edges in a longest path in that tree.
The tree is given as an array of edges where *edges[i]=[u,v]* is a bidirectional edge between nodes *u* and *v*. Each node has labels in the set {0, 1, ..., edges.length}

#### Examples :

**Input**: edges[][] = {(0, 1), (0, 2)}  
**Output**: 2

**Input**: edges[][] = {(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (1, 4), (4, 5)}  
**Output**: 4
